# Monte Carlo Prediction and Control 

## Overview
This repo is an implementation of 2 Major algorithtmns based on the Monte Carlo method inspired from the book RL : An intro sutton and barto. ON Policy learning without Exploring Starts and Off Policy learning with importance sampling are the algorithms implemented, their respective algorithm details are in the ipynb file itself. 


There are two main file `env.py` and `bot/robot.URDF`, the `env.py` file holds all the necessary methods required to run the environment and for the bot to take the necessary steps during the simulation whereas `bot/robot.URDF` hold the information of the bot, everything from joints to links. This repo is a submodule of another repo, "link" where I have explaiend the entire bot and environment dynamics in detail and even the pybullet simulation used. below is the image of the bot just to give an idea.



## How to run
